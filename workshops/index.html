                <h2>Stage to Play with Michael J Gellman</h2>
                <p>
                    For centuries, Improvisation has been a theatre created by actors for actors.

                <p>
                    Participants in Stage to Play are invited to join Michael J Gellman in a weekend
                    Masters Workshop Intensive to play, explore and transform as we discover methods
                    for creating and performing our own stories and myths.  The ensemble will create
                    the play idea, develop it through improvisation and present the finished project
                    Sunday night. We will focus on the very practical tools and techniques used to
                    explore as an ensemble and discover:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Playing and being truly present in the moment</li>
                    <li>Trusting ourselves and our characters in rehearsal and performance</li>
                    <li>Getting out of our own way</li>
                    <li>Re-discovering the JOY in performance</li>
                    <li>Our potential for creating unique characters with emotional and physical truth</li>
                    <li>Freedom to react and make discoveries in performance and script development</li>
                    <li>Methods of exploring and heightening for story creation</li>
                    <li>The 6 magic bullets for better dialogue in any improvisation</li>
                    <li>Ideas for creating original scripts and how to approach devised theatre projects and theatre from literary source</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Exciting and inspired performance comes from the courage to work outside of our
                    comfort zones. Come – Lets find the play inside the play.

                    Let your characters’ voices shine through! In this workshop, performers will learn
                    tricks to develop strong characters in an instant, connecting physicality & emotional
