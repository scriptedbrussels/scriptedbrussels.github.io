                <h2>C. K. Brown</h2>
                <p>Origin: France, America</p>
                <p>
                    C.K. Brown is a full-time art enthusiast with years of experience in acting.
                    Born in North Carolina but raised internationally, this Franco-American writer made her debut
                    on stage in a 2012 production of “Some Like It Hot” in Paris and has since done performances
                    of varying lengths in Prague, Rome, London, Manchester, and Brussels.
                    She has been formally trained by teachers in New York and London, and when she isn’t acting
                    or working, she’s probably discovering local theatre, spending time with friends, or traveling
                    to attend training sessions for acting.

                <p>Origin: Ireland</p>
                <p>
                    Originally from Ireland, Nickie has lived in Dublin, London and Brussels.
                    She has been an avid reader since her childhood days and, in 2004, she fulfilled a lifelong dream
                    of opening her own bookshop. It was located in Brussels and specialized in world literature and
                    personal development. Although her bookshop closed down after just five years of operation, she
                    continues to run a Book Club for people interested in exploring international fiction and self-help books.
                    In 2010, she self-published an adaptation of a classic book in the personal development genre, which
                    she uses in her life coaching practice. As an active dreamer, she has been keeping a dream journal
                    persistently for the last five years. She has attended a few creative writing workshops and classes,
                    and has written some short stories, acrostic poems and the occasional limerick.
                    “Waiting for Tomorrow” is her first play.
