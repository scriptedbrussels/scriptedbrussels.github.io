            <p>
                You know that script that's in your hard disk, and you always say "I'm going to finish that one day"?
            </p>

            <p>
                You know that story, that monologue, that idea, that's just waiting for the right occasion to blossom?
            </p>

            <p>
                That play you wrote, but you need the actors, or the director, or the theatre to try it out?
            </p>

            <p>
                Scripted Brussels is waiting for YOU!
            </p>

            <p>
                Any idea is welcome: full length plays, short scripts, monologues, screenplays, one-person-shows, comedy, drama... you can apply with anything, as long as it has value for you. All ages are welcome to apply.

                Here is a page of <a href="paq/">P.A.Q. (Probably Asked Questions)</a> to help you navigate the organization of the Festival.
            </p>

            <p>
                We're waiting for your scripts! Let's make it happen! Let's make it beautiful!
            </p>
