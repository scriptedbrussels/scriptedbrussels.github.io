    SCRIPTED BRUSSELS 2020

    Welcome to the Scripted Brussels 2020 website!

    You know that script that's in your hard disk, and you always say "I'm going to finish that one day"?
    You know that story, that monologue, that idea, that's just waiting for the right occasion to blossom?
    That play you wrote, but you need the actors, or the director, or the theatre to experiment it?

    Well, it's time for you to do the first step: Scripted Brussels is waiting for YOU in May 2020!
    Every idea is welcome: full length plays, short scripts, monologues, screenplays, one-person-shows, comedy, drama... you can apply with anything, as long as it has value for you.

    Here is a page of P.A.Q. (Probably Asked Questions) to help you navigate the organization of the Festival.

    ARE THERE ANY LIMITATIONS FOR THE SCRIPTS?
    We just ask for the scripts to be:
    - in English (if there are any words)
    - yours
    - never been played before

    WHAT WILL THE PLAYS BE LIKE? WHY DO YOU CALL THEM "READINGS"?
    The shows will be somewhere in between a play and a READING: this means the actors will perform with the script in their hands reading when necessary, with a  basic idea of scenic movements, intention, emotion, etc.
    It's more than just reading dialogues; it's less than a fully prepared play.
    That's why the props and the lighting will not be elaborate - because it's not a fully prepared play yet.

    SINCE IT'S A READING, DO I HAVE TO REHEARSE IT?
    Yes, it would be ideal. Not so much to have your actors memorize the part, but enough for them to know basic scene movemements, and to be already quite familiar with the script.

    WHAT'S THE IDEA BEHIND SCRIPTED BRUSSELS?
    Based on the intuition by Deborah Ann Smith and Process Theatre of creating Scripted Toronto, Scripted Brussels 2020 is the European edition of the theatre Festival where you can try your script in front of an audience at a not-yet-complete stage of the work. To see where it works best, if you need to change something, or just gain the confidence that your play is great and you can go on and produce it.
    Audience members will give feedback on the play, via slips of paper they can leave in a box at the end of the evening.

    IS THERE MONEY INVOLVED?
    Application is free, and unfortunately we are not able to give you a compensation for your show. So, basically no economic transactions happen between the Authors and the Festival.
    The audience will pay a ticket which will help cover the cost of the theatre.


    WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE THE ACTORS OR THE DIRECTOR?
    We can put you in touch with people that can fit your needs.
    Possible economic arrangements between the Authors and the Actors are made between them.


    WHAT ABOUT THE WORKSHOPS?
    During the days of Saturday and Sunday, there will be workshops of acting and writing for theatre.
    The schedule of workshops is not official yet - keep in touch!

    HOW DO I APPLY?
    To apply, send your script to scriptedbrussels2020@gmail.com together with your picture and your resume to upload on the site, in case your script gets selected.
    Please specify what kind, if any, of professional figures you need: typically, actors and director. We can put you in touch with people that might fit with your needs.
    APPLICATIONS ARE OPEN NOW!
    Applications close on November 30th.
    You will get an answer by December 31st at 23:59.
    Application is free.

    WHO DO I HAVE TO BRIBE TO GET MY APPLICATION THROUGH?
    Seriously...????
    Obviously we don't accept bribes.
    Not financial, at least.
    Well then, it would depend on the amount of money.
    Come to think of it, we DO accept bribes.
    Leave the 500-euro bills in an envelope by the tree.

    CAN I SPECIFY THE DAY I WOULD LIKE MY READING TO BE STAGED?
    To a point. It would really help the organization if you could be flexible to perform either Friday, Saturday or Sunday night.
    If there are extenuating circumstances which make it impossible to perform on a given date, specify it in the application and we'll try to do our best to meet your needs.


    WHERE DOES IT ALL HAPPEN?
    In the cozy atmosphere of Salle Artincelle
    rue de la Victoire 158
